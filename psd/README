-- calcPSD_timeresolved.py computes the time resolved Welch power spectrum and saves to disk. The output from here is used to check for oscillatory bumps. Note that it is not used anywhere else.

-- calcMorlet.py computes the morlet power spectrum, averages over 1sec blocks, and saves to disk. Note that the output from here is used for visualization purposes only (e.g. Figure 1) and is _not_ used to detect bursts. The burst detection requires the Morlet at full temporal resolution and is computed on the fly (too large to dump to disk).

-- getStateAveragedPowerSpectra.py computes the average Welch power spectrum for each patient, channel, state. This output is required to generate Panel d of Figure 2, Extended Data Figure 2, and Extended Data Figure 3 

-- figure1.py generates Figure 1 for the paper

-- extendedDataFigure2.py generates corresponding figure for the paper
