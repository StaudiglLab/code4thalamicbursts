joblib (1.4.2)
fooof (1.26.4)
scikit-learn (1.5.2)


NOTE: The versions for the packages indicate those on which the codes were tested to run. However, the code is also expected to run with other versions of the packages.

Code to generate figures of the manuscript
---------------

Following are the scripts for the figures in manuscript

-- figure 1 : psd/figure1.py                              NOTE: Running this requires full resolution raw data file to be present.
-- figure 2 : burst/figure2.py
-- figure 3 : burstAndREMs/figure3.py
-- figure 4 : burstWidth/figure4.py
-- figure 5 : localization/figure5.py
-- edf 1 : burstWidth/figure4.py
-- edf 2 : psd/extendedDataFigure2.py
-- edf 3 : connectivity/connectivityPlotForPaper.py
-- edf 4 : burst/plotExampleBurstDetection.py
-- edf 5 : eyeMovementDetection/topoAtEyeEvent.py
-- edf 6 : burstWidth/figure4.py

Demo
---------------
For a demo of the burst detection algorithm, please run burst/demoDetection.py (this should not take more than a few minutes on a typical computer).
This would run the entire algorithm on 15m of raw data extracted from one of the patients in our cohort. The 15m data contains 5m each of wakefullness, REM, and NREM sleep, extracted from the raw thalamic iEEG recording of the patient.
The script would produce an output summary figure, "burst/figures/bursts_demo.pdf" showing the burst rate as a function of time and frequency (in colorscale). The timestamps and frequencies corresponding to individual bursts can be found at "dataFilesPublic/burstFromMorlet/demo_R1-R2_selected.txt" while the list of bands with significantly elevated burst probabilities can be found at "burst/outfiles/bursts_detectedFrequencies_demo_selected.txt".
